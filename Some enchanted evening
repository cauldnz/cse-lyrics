Some enchanted evening
You will write a module
You will write a module, that passes code review
And somehow you know, you know even then
That on your next project youâ€™ll use it again.

Some enchanted evening
You will document it,
You will document it, with clear examples too.
The downloads will mount, though strange it may seem,
Your module could make it to usage mainstream.

Who can explain it? Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try!

Some enchanted evening,
When you write that module
When you write that module, that could be used again
Share with your Domain, your code they will hone,
Or all through your life you will hack all alone

Once you have shared it, ask for PRs too
Once you have shared it, ask for PRs too!
